Flask App for U-Net Segmentation Model with TensorFlow Lite

Overview
This Flask application serves as an interface for utilizing a U-Net segmentation model stored in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format. The U-Net model is capable of segmenting images, particularly useful for various computer vision tasks, including medical image analysis, semantic segmentation, and more.

Project Structure
web.wsgi: WSGI file for deploying the Flask application.

app/:
app.py: Flask application script containing routes and logic.
model.tflite: TensorFlow Lite model file for U-Net segmentation.
Aptfile: File listing system dependencies required for deployment.
Procfile: File specifying the commands to run the web application in a production environment.


Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Ensure that you have the TensorFlow Lite interpreter installed on your system.
Place your trained U-Net model in the app/ directory and name it model.tflite.
Usage
Run the Flask application using the command python app.py.
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Upload an image that you want to segment using the U-Net model.
Wait for the segmentation process to complete.
View the table of prediction for each pixel of the image

Deployment
To deploy this Flask application:
Configure your production server environment.
Use a production-ready WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI, Xampp, Heroku) to serve the Flask application.
Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to handle incoming requests and route them to the WSGI server.
Ensure that the TensorFlow Lite interpreter is available in your production environment.

Customization
Model Replacement: If you have a different TensorFlow Lite model or a different segmentation model altogether, replace model.tflite with your desired model file.

UI Enhancements: Customize the HTML templates and frontend styles in app/templates/ to improve the user interface and experience.
